# Frontend Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Routing Error in Protected Layout
**Problem:** The protected layout was trying to show login/register screens, which should only be in the main root layout.

**Fix:** Removed login and register from the protected layout in `frontend/app/(protected)/_layout.tsx`

### 2. Incorrect Redirect Path in Protected Index
**Problem:** The protected index was redirecting to `/login`, which would create an infinite loop.

**Fix:** Changed redirect in `frontend/app/(protected)/index.tsx` to `/(protected)/(tabs)`

### 3. Incorrect Navigation Path in AuthContext
**Problem:** The login function was trying to navigate to `/(protected)/(tabs)` which doesn't match the route structure.

**Fix:** Changed navigation path in `frontend/context/AuthContext.tsx` to `/(protected)/`

## Current Route Structure

```
/app
  /_layout.tsx (Root - with AuthProvider)
    /index.tsx (Entry point - redirects based on auth)
    /login.tsx
    /register.tsx
    /(protected)
      /_layout.tsx (Protected layout)
        /index.tsx (Redirects to tabs)
        /(tabs)
          /_layout.tsx
            /index.tsx (Home)
            /explore.tsx
        /modal.tsx
```

## How Routing Works Now

1. App starts → `app/index.tsx` checks auth status
2. If authenticated → redirects to `/(protected)/`
3. Protected index → redirects to `/(protected)/(tabs)` (home screen)
4. If not authenticated → redirects to `/login`
5. After login → redirects to `/(protected)/`

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Error: "Invalid route"
- **Cause:** Route path doesn't exist or is malformed
- **Solution:** Check the route exists in the file system and matches the path exactly

### Error: "useAuth must be used within AuthProvider"
- **Cause:** Component trying to use useAuth() outside of AuthProvider
- **Solution:** Make sure the component is rendered inside the AuthProvider in `_layout.tsx`

### Error: "Maximum update depth exceeded"
- **Cause:** Infinite redirect loop
- **Solution:** Check that redirects don't create circular references

## Testing

1. Start the app
2. Should redirect to login if not authenticated
3. After login, should redirect to protected area
4. Should see the home screen (tabs)
5. Closing and reopening app should maintain auth state
